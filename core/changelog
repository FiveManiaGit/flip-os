* Password Hashing
  > Passwords are now hashed so you don't need to worry about security breaches on the password system.

* Improved Tutorial
  > The tutorial is now shorter but have a better interface and a little flashing text on the bottom.

Note from FiveMania:
This may be the last update of Flip but I'm not sure.
This is why people can't just give the ideas and say about improvements without hurting me somehow.
I hope you guys enjoy the new update and keep coding!
